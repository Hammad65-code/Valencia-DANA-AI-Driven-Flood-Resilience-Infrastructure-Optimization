# Valencia-DANA-AI-Driven-Flood-Resilience-Infrastructure-Optimization
Developed a geospatial pipeline to model the 2024 Valencia flash floods, using K-Means Clustering and NDVI satellite data to identify critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.
Disaster Modeling & Satellite Analysis: Simulated the 2024 Valencia flash floods by integrating NASA Elevation Models with NDVI satellite data to map the "Absorption Gap" between urban concrete and green spaces.
AI-Optimized Solutions: Implemented K-Means Clustering to mathematically pinpoint high-priority locations for "Sponge City" infrastructure, demonstrating a potential 35% reduction in peak runoff.
Data Intelligence Dashboard: Developed a comprehensive visualization suite—including spatial heatmaps and risk histograms—to translate complex geospatial data into actionable recovery strategies for city planners.
