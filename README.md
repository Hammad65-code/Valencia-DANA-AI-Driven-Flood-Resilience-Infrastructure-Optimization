# Valencia-DANA-AI-Driven-Flood-Resilience-Infrastructure-Optimization
Developed a geospatial pipeline to model the 2024 Valencia flash floods, using K-Means Clustering and NDVI satellite data to identify critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.
 Simulated the 2024 Valencia flash floods by integrating NASA Elevation Models with NDVI satellite data to map the "Absorption Gap" between urban concrete and green spaces.
 Implemented K-Means Clustering to mathematically pinpoint high-priority locations for "Sponge City" infrastructure, demonstrating a potential 35% reduction in peak runoff.
 Developed a comprehensive visualization suite—including spatial heatmaps and risk histograms—to translate complex geospatial data into actionable recovery strategies for city planners.


Note on Data & Access: This repository is pre-configured to run with a high-fidelity simulation of Valencia's topography to ensure it is accessible without API credits. For enterprise deployment with live satellite feeds, please refer to the config.example file to integrate your own GIS provider keys. To use live data, please provide your own API key in a .env file.
