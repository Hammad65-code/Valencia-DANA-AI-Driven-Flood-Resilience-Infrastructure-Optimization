# Valencia-DANA-AI-Driven-Flood-Resilience-Infrastructure-Optimization
Developed a geospatial pipeline to model the 2024 Valencia flash floods, using K-Means Clustering and NDVI satellite data to identify critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.
 Simulated the 2024 Valencia flash floods by integrating NASA Elevation Models with NDVI satellite data to map the "Absorption Gap" between urban concrete and green spaces.
 Implemented K-Means Clustering to mathematically pinpoint high-priority locations for "Sponge City" infrastructure, demonstrating a potential 35% reduction in peak runoff.
 Developed a comprehensive visualization suite—including spatial heatmaps and risk histograms—to translate complex geospatial data into actionable recovery strategies for city planners.
