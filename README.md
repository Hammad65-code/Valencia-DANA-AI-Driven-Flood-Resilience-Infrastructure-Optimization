# Valencia-DANA-AI-Driven-Flood-Resilience-Infrastructure-Optimization
Developed a geospatial pipeline to model the 2024 Valencia flash floods, using K-Means Clustering and NDVI satellite data to identify critical infrastructure vulnerabilities.
The "Why" Behind the Project: I developed this model to analyze the catastrophic 2024 Valencia DANA event, moving beyond basic mapping to understand exactly why the city's traditional drainage failed under 400mm of extreme rainfall.
Deep Terrain Analysis: Using NASA Digital Elevation Models (DEM), I mapped the "path of least resistance" for floodwaters, identifying how the natural slope of the Valencia region funnels water into high-density urban corridors.
Concrete vs. Nature: I integrated NDVI satellite indices to calculate the "Absorption Gap," proving how the high ratio of concrete-to-green space in the city center creates a dangerous "runoff multiplier" during flash floods.
AI-Driven Solutions: Rather than just finding problems, I used K-Means Clustering to mathematically pinpoint the five most effective locations for new drainage nodes, ensuring maximum protection for the lowest infrastructure cost.
The "Sponge City" Impact: I simulated the implementation of nature-based solutions—like permeable pavements and rain gardens—which my model predicts could reduce peak flood runoff by up to 35% in high-risk zones.
Professional Stakeholder Delivery: To make the data useful for non-technical decision-makers, I built a Visual Intelligence Dashboard featuring risk histograms and land-use pie charts that translate raw code into a clear city-wide recovery strategy.
